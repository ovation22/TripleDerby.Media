## Feeding
- Take into account current Happiness

- Affects Happiness
    - If food is favorite
        - Could increase Happiness by zero-two
    - If food is accepted
        - Could increase Happiness by zero-one
    - If food is rejected
        - Could decrease Happines by naught, one, or two


## Training
- Affects Speed, Stamina, Agility, and/or Durability

- Train
- Rest

- SurlyDev suggests spookability out of the gate

- Take into account current Happiness
- Take into account Actual/Potential
- Closer to Potential less likely to land positive outcome
- Some training outcomes could differ based on the horse's leg type
- Take into account weather

### Training One (Straight Sprint)
- Affects Speed
    - Positive outcome could increase Speed by one
        - 25% chance to decrease Stamina by one
    - Negative outcome could decrease Speed by one
        - 50% chance to decrease Agility by one
    - Neutral outcome neither increases or decreases Speed
    - Best possible outcome could increase Speed by two

### Training Two (Long Track)
- Affects Stamina
    - Positive outcome could increase Stamina by one
        - 25% chance to decrease Speed by one
    - Negative outcome could decrease Stamina by one
        - 50% chance to decrease Durability by one
    - Neutral outcome neither increases or decreases Stamina
    - Best possible outcome could increase Stamina by two

### Rest
- Depends on stuffs
    - If you've been training hard
        - Could increase Durability by one
    - If you haven't been training hard
        - Could decrease Stamina by two
    - If you've only been doing Sprint
        - Does something

## Racing
- Take into account weather
- Take into account Leg Type
- Take into account Race surface

- Happiness could make it more likely to be a better performence
    - Multiplier on stats
- Speed used to determine how far a horse moves between ticks
- Stamina used to determine how little fall-off after distance
- Agility used to determine how easily/quickly lane changes happen
- Durability together with Stamina determins how little fall-off? <=== come back to this
- Durability makes you adapt to different surfaces?

### Race 1 (Kentucky Derby)
- Dirt
- 10 furlongs (2,012m)
- 2 minutes
- So, what does a tick cover?
    - ~1 tick per second?
    - ~12 ticks per furlong?
    - ~16.76 ticks per meter?
